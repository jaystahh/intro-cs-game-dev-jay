## Project Overview

This project is a simple text-based adventure game written in Python.

The goal of the game is to make choices that lead the player to either a win or a loss.  
The game uses variables, conditionals, and functions to control game flow and outcomes.

---

## How the Game Works

- The player is presented with a scenario.
- The player makes choices using text input.
- The program uses conditional logic to determine what happens next.
- The game ends in either a win or a loss.

---

## Concepts Used

This project demonstrates the following concepts:

- Variables and data types
- User input using `input()`
- Output using `print()`
- Conditional logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Functions to organize code

---

## How to Run the Program

1. Open a terminal in the `week1` folder.
2. Run the following command:

python text_adventure.py

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to play the game.

## Design Notes

Briefly describe your game:

- What is the setting?

The setting is a huge island named after 'Prison Island' in Sonic Adventure 2.  It masses around a jungle island that was built around the military and mostly used as a prison or used for laboratories for scientific research. 

- What choices does the player make?

The player, (Shadow the Hedgehog) chooses whether to run with the antagonist in the scenario, (Sonic the Hedgehog) to escape its impending doom as it blows up in the midst of a race. The other choice is to fight him, or insult him (just being cocky) enough to the point where the player gets punched and takes 10 damage total. Both choices causes the player to end up in some sort of conflict, whether that be a race or a straight up brawl.

- What determines a win or loss?

You can win by beating Sonic in either a fight or a race. If you win the fight, you may hurt Sonic enough to the point he wont be able to wake up until the island explodes, killing him. If you win the race, both the player and Sonic escapes the island, but the winning player would win with the chaos emerald, escaping death and winning the prize. If you lose the race, you'll be left behind and not escape the island in time and suffer the same fate Sonic does if he loses the fight. Losing the fight is also vice versa for the player.

## Reflection

Answer the following:

- What part of this project was the most challenging?

The most challenging part of week 1 was definitely the input conditionals and how they function together. It felt like a more complex step compared to variables and took me quite a while to understand. But understanding it the most definitely helped me in the long run and made the mini project a lot more fun to create.

- What concept do you feel most confident about after completing this?

I feel the most confident in the define function concept. It's a simple code once you know what goes where to work together. I love the customization to it as well to make any type of scenario and bring it to life.

(2–4 sentences total.)
